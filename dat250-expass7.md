# Expass 7

## Technical problems
I did not encounter any major technical problems when doing the task. I used docker for RabbitMQ. This worked great.

I had some problems with running multiple of the same application (multiple works) but I was able to test it.

## Code
The code is at: https://github.com/591337/dat250expass7 (a bit better organised.)

## Pending issues
I believe that I was able to do this.
