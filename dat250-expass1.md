# DAT250 Assignment 1: Report

### Docker.io
https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/591337/dat250/general

### Technical problems during setup
Some things like Git and IntelliJ I have already installed. I 
downloaded SDKman, a new java version, Gradle and Podman.

During the setup process, there were some issues. I had a problem
with the java version. The JAVA_HOME path, was set to something that
doesn't exist on my setup anymore. I was able to change this.

Else it went fine. I had some situations where I didn't open a new 
console after doing stuff and got confused when it didn't work. That's
not a problem, it's me being stupid.

### Validation
I didn't go through a thorough validation. I did what the task asked
me to do and checked that it did what I expected it to do. It does :)
